TODO
----

-  better server-side caching, with persistence, separated from the webserver
-  fix terrible 500 error vomit, with some proper handling of lfm username misspellings and other common UI caused errors
-  extend the festival list to all festivals known by Musicmetric, via auto gen call, when such a call exists
